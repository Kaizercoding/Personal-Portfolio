            <center><h4>Exploring the stars</h4></center>
            <center><p>One of my most avid interests is astronomy. Ever since I was young I was fascinated by the cosmos and the mysteries it hides. I aim to learn and explore this beautiful other world and to grow my knowledge. <br>
            I've had a lot of experience with applications like <br><li><a href ="https://spaceengine.org/"> Space engine</a></li> <br>which I have used to take various screenshots just like the one at the top of the page.</p></center>

            <center><h4>Documenting my life</h4></center>
            <center><p>Throughout my life I have never been one for note taking or documenting what goes on but over the recent years I have found a love for it. Being able to organise my ideas in one place and look back on them have benefited me not only personally but also academically in my studies. 
                <br /> My application of choice for this process is <br /> <li><a href="https://obsidian.md/"">Obsidian</a></li> <br /> Like I mentioned this has benefited me in all aspects of my life, even when it came to making this website!</p>
